# Energy Community Asset Simulator Configuration
# This file contains configurable parameters for different structure types

# General battery system defaults (used for all battery systems unless overridden by structure type)
batterySystem:
  # Default maximum charge power for battery systems in kW
  chargePower: 5
  # Default maximum discharge power for battery systems in kW
  dischargePower: 5

# Structure-specific configurations override built-in defaults
