# Energy Community Asset Simulator Configuration
# This file contains configurable parameters for different structure types

# Structure-specific configurations override built-in defaults
structureTypes:
  solarFarm:
    solarSystem:
      # Higher scale factor for solar farms to simulate large installations
      # 8x means 8 times the base solar generation from profile data
      scaleFactor: 8
    load:
      # Solar farms have no load consumption (pure generation)
      scaleFactor: 0
  
  evStation:
    evCharger:
      # EV stations typically have multiple charging slots
      # 3 slots allows for multiple vehicles charging simultaneously
      chargingSlots: 3
    load:
      # EV stations have no additional load beyond the charging itself
      scaleFactor: 0
  
  smallHouse:
    load:
      # Small houses consume 2x the base load profile
      # Represents typical single-family home consumption
      scaleFactor: 2
  
  hugeHouse:
    load:
      # Large houses consume 10x the base load profile
      # Represents large residential buildings or small commercial properties
      scaleFactor: 10
